### **Tool Maintenance**

To ensure this tool stays up to date and so that the team benefits for future bug fixes, feature enhancements, and overall improvements made to the base template, it is important to periodically check for updates, and apply any that are available to the master template. 

**Keeping the Master Repository Up to Date with Public Template Changes**

To ensure the master template stays up to date with any new changes in the Issueops template, follow these steps:

1. **Check for Updates**: Regularly monitor the public template repository for any new releases, updates, or changes. Visit the repository's page or subscribe to notifications to stay informed about the latest developments.

2. **Clone Your Repository**: If the personal repository hasn't already been cloned to the local machine, open the GitHub console, navigate to the repository's page, and click on the "Code" button. Copy the SSH URL.

3. **Open the Terminal**: Open the terminal or command prompt on the local machine. Ensure Git is installed and configured.

4. **Navigate to the Desired Location**: Navigate to the directory where the personal repository is to be cloned using the `cd` command. For example, if a user wants to clone it into a folder named "my-repo," use the following command:

   ```
   cd path/to/my-repo
   ```

   Replace `path/to/my-repo` with the actual path to your desired directory.

5. **Clone Your Repository**: In the terminal, run the following command to clone a personal repository:

   ```
   git clone <Your-Personal-issueOps-Repository>
   ```

   This will create a local copy of the personal repository on your machine.

6. **Add the Public Template as a Remote**: In the terminal, navigate into the repository's directory using the `cd` command. Run the following command to add the public template repository as a remote reference:

   ```
   git remote add template git@github.com:actions/importer-issue-ops.git
   ```

   This command adds a remote reference named "template" to the local repository.

7. **Fetch the Template Changes**: Run the following command to fetch the latest changes from the public template repository:

   ```
   git fetch template
   ```

   This command retrieves the latest changes from the public template repository without merging them into a users branch.

8. **Merge the Template Changes**: To merge the template changes into the repository, run the following command:

   ```
   git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

   This command merges the changes from the `template/main` branch (or another specific branch) into the repository.If there are merge conflicts, identify the conflicting files and try to resolve them.

9. **Review and Commit the Changes**: Review the changes made by the merge. If everything is satisfactory, commit the changes using the following command:

   ```
   git commit -m "Merge template changes"
   ```

   Add an appropriate commit message describing the merge.

10. **Push the Changes**: Finally, push the merged changes to the remote repository using the following command:

    ```
    git push origin main
    ```

    This command pushes the changes to the `main` branch (or default branch) of the remote repository.

**Other Maintenance Steps** 

1. **Secret** 

    1. Make sure repository secrets are not expired when they are used in the workflow.  If they do expire, a new one should be created with the required scope.

    2. Keeping secrets from expiring and promptly creating new secrets when needed ensures that workflows continue to operate without interruption while maintaining the necessary level of security.
